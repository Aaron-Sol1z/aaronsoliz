                        <p>Hi there! I hope you're having a good day so far.</p>
                        <p>
                            I'm Aaron Soliz, an aspiring software engineer and front-end developer based in Sacramento, California.
                            My journey into computer science began when I joined a club in the fourth grade and created a cute website with my friends about the ancient wonders of the world.
                            Whenever I have my hands on a keyboard (or a pencil when I feel like sketching), the feeling of creating something new from the tips of my fingers and watching the end result slowly form feels satisfying.
                            Even during all those nights where I get caught up in what I'm doing and realize I'm up later than I should be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fast forward to now, I'm proud to say that I am a graduate from the California State University of Sacramento and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2023.
                            When I'm not watching the latest blockbusters or renowned classics, I'm expanding my working knowledge and have found my calling in software and front-end development.
                            You can check out some projects I've worked on <a href="./projects.html">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Being on the autism spectrum, struggles in academics and social skills presented themselves.
                            But with help from my family, friends, and the community that I was raised in, I was able to give it everything I got and perform to the best of my ability in my academics.
                            Every day, I am grateful that I had a good team that supported me in every step in my journey, and this eventually became the foundation of my work philosophy.
                            I believe that as innovators, we are stronger as a team, and I would love to be a part of yours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What I can bring to the table, in addition to my set of skills, is a smile on my face and a good attitude.
                            I can be a focused teammate that will always have reaching goals and the bigger picture in mind.
                            If there are things that I'm not familiar with, I can make up for it by being a quick and eager learner so that I can get up to speed and be an effective contributor.
                            Most importantly, I will be a member that wants to engage in insightful discussions with teammates, whether I'm presenting ideas or listening to yours.
                        </p>
